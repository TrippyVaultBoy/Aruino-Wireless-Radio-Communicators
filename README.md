# Aruino-Wireless-Radio-Communicators
This project uses two Arduino Nanos, two NRF24L0 Radio Modules, and one 16x2 LCD screen. A set of one Transmitter and one Reciever will be able to communicate to each other using the NRF24L01 modules. The user can input a message into the Serial Monitor and sent the mesage to the reciever. The Reciever will then display the mesage on the 16x2 LCD screen
